# Hyper-parameter tuning
Interested in seeing how to tune your scikit-learn models? This small project shows two different approaches on how to
get this done. Firstly, the usual approach, with GridSearchCV. Another approach is shown too (experimental at time of writing),
the HalvingGridSearchCV object, which does a good job hyper-parameter tuning in **much** less time than GridSearchCV.
